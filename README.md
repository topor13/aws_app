This is the final task for learning to android.
We only need to use the following technology stack:
- JDK 1.6-1.8;
- Android SDK API version 16-26;
- Support Library Packages (v4, v7, v8, v13, v14, v17);
- FasterXML/Jackson.
Any other libraries are prohibited.

In this project I need to implement one of the following tasks:
- Implement the weather view with OpenWeatherMap.
Perhaps not for all weather conditions, but only for the current temperature, the likelihood of precipitation, etc.
(simple things that are returned immediately by text).
Determine the weather at the current location (when determining it with an accuracy of better than 100 meters) or give an address.

- On the url to make a preview (as in the telegram, VC, etc.).
If the address of the page is entered, the application goes to the network, forms the title (the title of the page),
a description (meta description or, if not, the first words of the text)
and a preview image (from meta tags for social media or, if not, the first img on the page).
Displays in a clickable form.

- View RSS of the hub: https://habrahabr.ru/rss/hubs/all/. Output list with all attributes: tags, hubs, etc. (it's all in RSS).
